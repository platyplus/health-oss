## Electronic Health Record Systems

### [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/) <Badges user="openmrs" repo="openmrs-core" />

OpenMRS is a software platform and a reference application that enables design of a customized medical records system (MRS). It is a common platform upon which health informatics and eHealth efforts in low-income countries can be built. The system is based on a conceptual database structure that is not dependent on the actual types of medical information required to be collected or on particular data collection forms and so can be customized for different uses.

OpenMRS is based on the principle that information should be stored in a way that makes it easy to summarize and analyse (i.e., minimal use of free text and maximum use of coded information). At its core is a concept dictionary that stores all diagnoses, tests, procedures, drugs, and other general questions and potential answers.

### [OpenHIM](http://openhim.org/) <Badges user="jembi" repo="openhim-core-js" />

The OpenHIM allows you to secure and view requests to your web service APIs. It acts as a reverse proxy to your upstream services and while doing so enables visibility into your service-oriented architecture (SOA) by logging each request and by providing metrics about requests hitting your services. It also provides a central entry point into your SOA and allows you to secure access through mutual TLS or basic-auth.

## Surveillance

### [Reveal](https://akros.com/mspray/) <Badges user="onaio" repo="mspray" />

To ensure interventions reach recommended coverage thresholds, it is necessary to know exactly how many homes should be targeted and their precise locations. Reveal, formerly mSpray, is a spatial mapping and monitoring platform that optimizes health intervention coverage through spatial planning, tasking, in-app navigation support, role-specific dashboards, and built-in decision-making protocols to drive intervention planning. This approach optimizes intervention coverage with data accuracy and transparency. By improving coverage and smart targeting interventions, resources will be spent more effectively and more lives will be saved. We call this approach precision service delivery.

### [Ona](https://ona.io/) <Badges user="onaio" repo="onadata" />

ONA is an actively maintained solution whose developers are responsive to the needs of their users, which include a large number of humanitarian organizations.

ONA is based on the Xforms standard. The analysis features on the website are getting better and while ONA is still not a complete analysis solution in itself, it can probably answer a significant share of an operation’s needs, especially closer to field level. User management options are particularly rich, especially for an organization looking at managing different units (country, regions, types of programs) on a single account.

It doesn’t offer advanced features such as case management and isn’t well-suited for
monitoring.

### [FrontlineSMS](https://www.frontlinesms.com/) <Badges user="frontlinesms" repo="frontlinesms2" />
