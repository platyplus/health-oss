# Introduction

## Rationale

This site has two objectives:

- to guide the health organisations in the technical component of their digital interventions, in providing them a landscape of the available technologies that may be directly implemented, or that may be used in the design of a custom solution.
- to inform the developers about the existing technologies that may be of some help in their work with the above organisations.

This list of software is not exhaustive, as the subject is too broad to run a full-range benchmark, and as some pretty exiting technologies may not bring added value to the current status quo in the LMIC digital health sector. It also reflects the personal view and experience of the author. Some items should be added to the list, don't hesitate to contribute.
