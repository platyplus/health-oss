# Introduction

## Rationale

This site has two objectives:

- to guide the health organisations in the technical component of their digital interventions, in providing them a landscape of the available technologies that may be directly implemented, or that may be used in the design of a custom solution.
- to inform the developers about the existing technologies that may be of some help in their work with the above organisations.
