# Programming languages

## [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

Over the past years, JavaScript became the most popular programming language in the open-source community.
It has been initially designed to add dynamic features to web pages, but became more an more mature and now offers comprehensive frameworks to handle modern web applications.
JavaScript is also now commonly used on the server side with the Node.js framework.

### [Node](https://nodejs.org/) <Badges user="nodejs" repo="node" />

Node is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript on any platform, outside of a web browser. It is used to develop backend services, and comes with a vast set of libraries. The following list is by far not exhaustive, but presents the main packages that can be of some use when developing Node applications.

#### [Express](https://expressjs.com) <Badges user="expressjs" repo="express" />

Express is the most popular Node HTTP server. Express is described as a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js". It is used in production by companies such as IBM, Accenture or Uber. Lots of [additional libraries](https://github.com/rajikaimal/awesome-express) are also available to extend its core features.

#### [Koa](https://koajs.com) <Badges user="koajs" repo="koa" />

Koa is another Node HTTP middleware. It is designed for high performance and to allow the use of the ES2017 async functions. In order to ensure high performance, Koa is minimalist out of the box, but an active community worked on [libraries](https://github.com/ellerbrock/awesome-koa) to extend its initial features.

#### [Hapi](https://hapi.dev) <Badges user="hapijs" repo="hapi" />

Hapi is a more comprehensive HTTP server that is designed to serve as a REST API.
It comes out of the box with the most commonly required features, such as an authentication and authorisation framework, internationalisation, data validation... An active community also developed several [additional modules](https://hapi.dev/family/?sort=name).

#### [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) <Badges user="jaredhanson" repo="passport" />

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) <Badges user="microsoft" repo="TypeScript" />

TypeScript is a programming language that has been built on top of JavaScript. It adds some missing features to JavaScript, in particular the ability to define types, so the development experience is improved, and the risk of bugs is mitigated. It is maintained by Microsoft.

## [Python](https://www.python.org/)

## [PHP](https://www.php.net/) <Badges user="php" repo="php-src" />

Historically, PHP is one of the first scripting languages available for creating websites. Although the language significantly evolved since, it tends to be outweighed by more dynamic communities such as Python or JavaScript. However, PHP is mastered by numerous developers, and the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework offers a serious solution for bringing up a solid application backend.

## [Java](https://www.java.com/)

Java is one of the most common programming languages. It is backed by Oracle. While some of the blocks remain proprietary, most of Java has now been open sourced.

Java is one of the programming languages that are the mostly used in corporations, but tends to be overshadowed by other languages such as JavaScript or Python when it comes to the open source world. It may be due to the fact that Java tends to be excessively verbose, and that the use of a Java Runtime Environment, that allows to run any code on any type of operating system, became a less interesting feature as [containerisation of applications](/devops.html#containers) became the new trend to deploy and run services.

## Go

## [R](https://www.r-project.org/)

R is a specialised programming language for statistical computing. It is vastly used in data science, and data specialists may want to know how to use it in order to mine and extract evidence from existing datasets. It is sometimes the preferred tool of epidemiologists for data processing, such as in the [R4Epis](https://r4epis.netlify.com/) initiative.
