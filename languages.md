# Programming languages

## [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

Over the past years, JavaScript became the most popular programming language in the open-source community.
It has been initially designed to add dynamic features to web pages, but became more an more mature and now offers comprehensive frameworks to handle modern web applications.
JavaScript is also now commonly used on the server side with the Node.js framework.

### [Node](https://nodejs.org/) <Badges user="nodejs" repo="node" />

Node is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript on any platform, outside of a web browser. It is used to develop backend services, and comes with a vast set of libraries. The following list is by far not exhaustive, but presents the main packages that can be of some use when developing Node applications.

#### [Express](https://expressjs.com) <Badges user="expressjs" repo="express" />

Express is the most popular Node HTTP server. Express is described as a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js". It is used in production by companies such as IBM, Accenture or Uber. Lots of [additional libraries](https://github.com/rajikaimal/awesome-express) are also available to extend its core features.

#### [Koa](https://koajs.com) <Badges user="koajs" repo="koa" />

Koa is another Node HTTP middleware. It is designed for high performance and to allow the use of the ES2017 async functions. In order to ensure high performance, Koa is minimalist out of the box, but an active community worked on [libraries](https://github.com/ellerbrock/awesome-koa) to extend its initial features.

#### [Hapi](https://hapi.dev) <Badges user="hapijs" repo="hapi" />

Hapi is a more comprehensive HTTP server that is designed to serve as a REST API.
It comes out of the box with the most commonly required features, such as an authentication and authorisation framework, internationalisation, data validation... An active community also developed several [additional modules](https://hapi.dev/family/?sort=name).

#### [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) <Badges user="jaredhanson" repo="passport" />

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) <Badges user="microsoft" repo="TypeScript" />

TypeScript is a programming language that has been built on top of JavaScript. It adds some missing features to JavaScript, in particular the ability to define types, so the development experience is improved, and the risk of bugs is mitigated. It is maintained by Microsoft.
