## Operating Systems

### Ubuntu

Many Linux distributions are available, but Ubuntu is one the the most popular ones and has a fast learning curve. Its server version is commonly used as a basis for many services.

### [MSF NixOS](https://github.com/MSF-OCB/NixOS) <Badges user="MSF-OCB" repo="NixOS"/>

The [MSF](https://www.msf.org/) Operational Center of Brussels configured [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) to be deployed in lightweight [NUC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Unit_of_Computing) local servers. It standardises the installation, maintenance and monitoring of a cluster of remote server that is kept at a state defined in a unique Git repository. It is orchestrated through secure SSH relays and does not require a reliable connectivity.

## Networking and Security

### OpenSSL

### LetsEncrypt

### AES

### GnuPG

## Reverse Proxies

### [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) <Badges user="containous" repo="traefik" />

Traefik can be used as an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, and goes along with Docker and Docker swarm pretty well, as it supports annotations, meaning there is no need to change Traefik's configuration when endpoint services change, as service-specific rules are defined together with each Docker service.
